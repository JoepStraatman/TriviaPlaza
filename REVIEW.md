Review by Bozana Miletic:

- Too less comments.
- No explanation what classes do. Hard to understand this way.
- Users get 1 point bonus on first correct answer?
- Not possible to log out
- Not resumming in same state as before closing the app.

Not much to see further than this. Lots of code, hard to understand it all so quickly. But the app looks nice.



#Fixed everything in the final build
